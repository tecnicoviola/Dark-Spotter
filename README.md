The Dark Pattern Buster project aims to develop a browser extension or app interface that detects and alerts users about “fake reviews” and “false urgency” dark patterns, a type of deceptive design pattern used by some websites to manipulate users. The project focuses on engineering students from India, encouraging out-of-the-box thinking and innovation to transform the way we interact with technology.

Tech Stack

Based on the provided information, the Dark Pattern Buster project likely employs a tech stack that includes:

Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for building the browser extension or app interface, providing a streamlined user experience.
Backend: Python for data analysis and processing, possibly using machine learning algorithms to identify dark patterns.
Infrastructure: A secure and scalable central/distributed server infrastructure for hosting and managing the repository of known dark patterns, ensuring continuous updates.
The project’s tech stack is designed to:

Detect dark patterns through data analysis and machine learning
Provide clear and actionable information to users when a dark pattern is detected
Offer a user-friendly interface for users to make informed decisions
Ensure secure and scalable data storage and processing
